## Why this blog?

This is the first of what I hope is many posts to this blog.  Any competent programmer comes
across a myriad of problems on a day to day basis and some of these problems require a bit of
creativity and outside of the box thinking to get through them.  I hope to document some of
the more interesting ones I come across myself during both my work and personal efforts.

Some of the issues I come across may not be totally public information.  In those cases, I will
sanitize the example such that I can disclose the information without violating any confidentiality.

## Topics of discussion

The primary purpose of this site will be to discuss interesting issues in software engineering and 
architecture.  However, I reserve the right to discuss a multitude of topics.  These could include
gaming, pop culture, politics or finance.  As the disclaimer states, all opinions are my own and do 
not represent my employer.

## Consultation

Speaking of employer, I do occasionally take on consulting projects.  If you are interested in discussing
your needs, feel free to get in [touch](mailto:chris@tartamella.me).
